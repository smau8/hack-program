# timezone package

### Goal
Creating an installable package: `timezone` is a package that returns times relative to three regions in the US. The package is written in `Python3` and can be run directly through a command line interface. `timezone` was created using both [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) and [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) packages and their respective documentations. 

### Commands
To run the program via command line: `timezone --region`. 
There are three regions that can be inputted include: eastcoast, westcoast, midwest.
`timezone` will return time differences respective to the region entered.

### Current version
The current version of this package is `0.1.0`. The newest iteration of `timezone` requires `pandas` as a dependency.
